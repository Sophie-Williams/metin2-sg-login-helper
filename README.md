**Metin2 Singapore login helper**

This project was made back in late 2017 with the intention of
making loging in faster & not having to remember many different passwords
and usernames.

[Download](https://github.com/kichiro1337/metin2-sg-login-helper/releases)

**Includes:**
- Account management system with autosave/load
- Automatic update checking incase the client is outdated
- No direct process interaction (No hooks/read/write memory)
- Ability to restart the account manager and still know which game instance is launched using it
- Ability to relog accounts by terminating the managed instance
- Ability to login into accounts using nicknames and the username
- Discord rich presence (No presence keys included)

**How to use:**
- Compile using 'Release x86'
- Put the executeable and the discord library in the Metin2 Singapore game folder
- Run the executeable and follow the setup process
! If there is a game update, you will need to wait for the patcher to finish downloading and start the game once it's done
  the account manager will do everything else - and restart itself
! Do not change the executeable name
  
**Does Metin2 Singapore allow this:**
- Honestly, I don't know why they would not allow this kind of automation, if you don't feel secure using this
then you might should not use it.
- People do use macros to login aswell, this is just a more advanced version of a macro.
- Metin2 Singapore does not have any client-sided 'anti-cheating' measures in place so there is nothing to worry about.

The project is fairly old and so is my coding style in this.
I was thinking about re-coding this project, but I have no use for this anymore
since I have quit playing Metin2 Singapore a long time ago.
If you would like to improve code in this, you may do so.
